In this project we are detecting depression from users post, user can upload post in the form of text file, image file or audio file, this project can help peoples who are in depression by sending motivated messages to them. Now-a-days people are using online post services to interact with each other compare to human to human interaction. So by analyzing users post this application can detect depression and send motivation messages to them. Administrator of this application will send motivation messages, links to movies, suggestion of books to boost the mental health, and songs for refreshment to all peoples who are in depression. To detect depression we are using SVM (support vector machine) algorithm which analyses users post and give result as negative or positive. If users express depression words in post then SVM detect it as a negative post else positive post. To implement this project we are using python Speech Recognition API which will read text from audio files and then SVM will analyze that text to detect depression, user can also upload images via post and python Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) API can read text from uploaded image and then SVM will detect depression from that text, User can upload post in text file also.
